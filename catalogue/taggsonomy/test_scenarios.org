*** DONE Exclusion between "Taggsonomy" and "Tagging" fails if there's already a TagSet containing both tags
* New inclusion relations
** Including "Programming" under "Django"
*** DONE fails, as that's a circular inclusion, which is not allowed
** Including "Django" under "Web Development"
*** DONE adds "Web Development" to any TagSet already containing "Django"
*** TODO disallows exclusion between "Programming" and "Web Devbelopment"
** Including "Taggsonomy" under "Tagging"…
*** TODO adds "Tagging" and "Knowledge Management" to any TagSet already containing "Taggsonomy"
*** TODO fails? if there's already a TagSet containing both "Tagging" and "Programming", or does what, instead?
** … and under "Python"…
*** TODO fails because "Programming" excludes "Knowledge Management"
*** … *after* unexcluding "Programming" and "Knowledge Management"
**** TODO succeeds and adds "Python" and "Programming" to any TagSet already containing "Tagging"
**** TODO disallows exclusion between "Programming" and "Knowledge Management"
