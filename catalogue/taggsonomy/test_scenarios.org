* Basic inclusion
** Single direct inclusion
*** DONE Adding "Tagging" to TagSet also adds "Knowledge Management"
*** DONE Adding "Python" to TagSet also adds "Programming", but NOT "Django"
** Double direct inclusion
*** DONE Adding "JavaScript" to TagSet also adds "Programming" and "Web Development"
** Direct and indirect inclusion*
*** DONE Adding "Django" to TagSet also adds "Python" and "Programming"
* Basic exclusion
*** DONE Adding "Programming" to a TagSet previously containing "Knowledge Management" removes "Knowledge Management"
*** DONE Exclusion between "Taggsonomy" and "Tagging" fails if there's already a TagSet containing both tags
* New inclusion relations
** Including "Programming" under "Django"
*** DONE fails, as that's a circular inclusion, which is not allowed
** Including "Django" under "Web Development"
*** DONE adds "Web Development" to any TagSet already containing "Django"
*** DONE disallows exclusion between "Programming" and "Web Development"
** Including "Taggsonomy" under "Tagging"…
*** *without* 'update_tagsets' (default)
**** DONE does not add any other tags to a TagSet already containing "Taggsonomy"
**** TODO succeeds, even if there's already a TagSet containing both "Taggsonomy" and "Programming", but it does not touch those TagSets
*** *with* 'update_tagsets'
**** DONE adds "Tagging" and "Knowledge Management" to any TagSet already containing "Taggsonomy"
**** TODO fails, if there's already a TagSet containing both "Taggsonomy" and "Programming"
The alternative would be to silently remove the tag "Programming" when "Knowledge Management" gets added, which might not be what users would expect.
** … and under "Python"…
*** TODO fails because "Programming" excludes "Knowledge Management"
*** … *after* unexcluding "Programming" and "Knowledge Management"
**** TODO succeeds and adds "Python" and "Programming" to any TagSet already containing "Tagging"
**** TODO disallows exclusion between "Programming" and "Knowledge Management"
** … and under "Django"…
*** TODO fails because "Programming" excludes "Knowledge Management"
*** … *after* unexcluding "Programming" and "Knowledge Management"
**** TODO succeeds and adds "Django", "Python" and "Programming" to any TagSet already containing "Tagging"
**** TODO disallows exclusion between "Programming" and "Knowledge Management"
