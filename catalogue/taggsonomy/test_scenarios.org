* Basic inclusion
** Single direct inclusion
- Adding "Tagging" to TagSet also adds "Knowledge Management"
- Adding "Python" to TagSet also adds "Programming", but NOT "Django"
** Double direct inclusion
- Adding "JavaScript" to TagSet also adds "Programming" and "Web Development"
** Direct and indirect inclusion
- Adding "Django" to TagSet also adds "Python" and "Programming"
* Basic exclusion
- Adding "Programming" to a TagSet previously containing "Knowledge Management"
  removes "Knowledge Management"
- Exclusion between "Taggsonomy" and "Tagging" fails if there's already a TagSet
  containing both tags
* New inclusion relations
** Including "Programming" under "Django"
- fails, as that's a circular inclusion, which is not allowed
** Including "Django" under "Web Development"
-  adds "Web Development" to any TagSet already containing "Django"
-  disallows exclusion between "Programming" and "Web Devbelopment"
** Including "Taggsonomy" under "Tagging"…
- adds "Tagging" and "Knowledge Management" to
  any TagSet already containing "Taggsonomy"
- fails? if there's already a TagSet containing both "Tagging" and "Programming",
  or does what, instead?
** … and under "Python"…
- fails because "Programming" excludes "Knowledge Management"
*** … *after* unexcluding "Programming" and "Knowledge Management"
- succeeds and adds "Python" and "Programming" to
  any TagSet already containing "Tagging"
- disallows exclusion between "Programming" and "Knowledge Management"
** … and under "Django"…
- fails because "Programming" excludes "Knowledge Management"
*** … *after* unexcluding "Programming" and "Knowledge Management"
- succeeds and adds "Django", "Python" and "Programming" to
  any TagSet already containing "Tagging"
- disallows exclusion between "Programming" and "Knowledge Management"
